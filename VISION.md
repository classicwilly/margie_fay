# THE GEOMETRY ENGINE

**Not an app. An operating system for resilience infrastructure.**

---

## THE CORE INSIGHT

**We're not building:**
- "Wonky Sprout - app for neurodivergent people"
- "Phenix Framework - divorce support platform"
- "Another productivity/coordination/wellness app"

**We're building:**

# **A TOPOLOGY CONSTRUCTOR WITH AI AS CO-ARCHITECT**

---

## HOW IT WORKS

### STEP 1: Define Your Vertices

**AI asks:** "What are the 4 anchor points in your life right now?"

**User answers (infinite configurations):**
- **Family:** "Me, my ex, Kid 1, Kid 2"
- **Work:** "Strategy, Execution, Feedback, Growth"
- **Personal:** "Body, Mind, Heart, Soul"
- **Community:** "Events, Resources, Communication, Action"
- **Abstract:** "Past (healing), Present (stability), Future (growth), Support (network)"

**AI doesn't judge. It asks:** "Are these your 4 vertices?"

### STEP 2: Define Your Edges

**AI asks:** "How do these vertices connect? What flows between them?"

**User defines all 6 edges:**
- Vertex 1 ↔ Vertex 2: [relationship/protocol]
- Vertex 1 ↔ Vertex 3: [relationship/protocol]
- Vertex 1 ↔ Vertex 4: [relationship/protocol]
- Vertex 2 ↔ Vertex 3: [relationship/protocol]
- Vertex 2 ↔ Vertex 4: [relationship/protocol]
- Vertex 3 ↔ Vertex 4: [relationship/protocol]

**AI generates complete graph. Tests K₄ topology. Visualizes mesh.**

### STEP 3: Define Your Protocols

**AI asks:** "What needs to happen at each vertex? What are the protocols?"

**User defines (or AI suggests from template library):**
- Vertex protocols (what happens here)
- Edge protocols (what flows between vertices)
- Crisis protocols (Missing Node Protocol)
- Deadlock protocols (Fifth Element)

**AI generates modules. Creates interfaces. Deploys to tetrahedron.**

### STEP 4: Connect to Mesh

**AI asks:** "Privacy level?"
- Private (just these 4 vertices)
- Semi-private (visible to similar tetrahedrons)
- Public (discoverable, template-eligible)

**User chooses. Tetrahedron joins global mesh. Can discover/connect with similar structures.**

---

## THE MAGIC

**Every user builds a DIFFERENT app.**

**But they're all running the SAME TOPOLOGY.**

### User A: "Divorce Co-Parenting Support System"
- **Vertices:** Parent 1, Parent 2, Child 1, Child 2
- **Modules:** Handoff coordinator, Schedule manager, Emergency contact, Wellness tracker

### User B: "Startup Coordination System"
- **Vertices:** CEO, CTO, COO, Product Lead
- **Modules:** Decision log, Sprint planner, Feedback aggregator, Metrics dashboard

### User C: "Personal Integration System"
- **Vertices:** Body, Mind, Heart, Soul
- **Modules:** Somatic tracking, Thought journal, Connection log, Meaning prompts

**SAME GEOMETRY. DIFFERENT CONTENT. INFINITE CONFIGURATIONS.**

---

## THE AI'S ROLE

**Not:** "Here's what I think you need"

**But:** "What do YOU need? I'll help you build it."

### AI as Co-Architect:
1. **Asks discovery questions** (What are your 4 vertices?)
2. **Tests topology** (Is it K₄? All edges connected?)
3. **Suggests protocols** (Based on context and similar tetrahedrons)
4. **Generates code** (Creates actual modules/interfaces)
5. **Deploys infrastructure** (Spins up tetrahedron on mesh)
6. **Monitors health** (Guardian Node watches for instability)
7. **Suggests adjustments** (Fifth Element if deadlock, Missing Node if loss)

**Not prescriptive. GENERATIVE.**

---

## THE PLATFORM IS

### 1. Geometry Engine

**Enforces:**
- Must be 4 vertices (K₄ complete graph)
- Must have 6 edges (all connections defined)
- Must define protocols (what happens at vertices/edges)
- Must handle node loss (Missing Node Protocol)
- Must resolve deadlock (Fifth Element Protocol)

### 2. Module Generator

**User says:** "I need to track my kids' emotional states"

**AI generates in 30 seconds:**
- Status Board for each child (toggles: happy, sad, overwhelmed, angry, okay)
- Parent dashboard (both kids' status at once)
- Alert system (Guardian Node notifies if both distressed)
- History log (patterns over time)
- Edge integration (how kids' states affect co-parent communication)

**Deploys instantly. User can modify. AI learns from usage.**

### 3. Mesh Network

**All tetrahedrons connect:**
- Private messaging within tetrahedron
- Discovery feed (find similar structures)
- Template library (copy proven configurations)
- Cluster formation (4 tetrahedrons → 16 people → fractal scaling)

### 4. Protocol Validator

**Tests:**
- Topology valid? (K₄ complete graph)
- Edges defined? (all 6 connections)
- Protocols executable? (AI can generate working code)
- Mesh integration working? (can connect to other tetrahedrons)
- Resilience tested? (survives node loss)

## THE USER EXPERIENCE

### Onboarding (10 minutes)

```
Welcome to Wonky Sprout.

You're about to build your own resilience infrastructure.

First, let's identify your 4 anchor points.

These could be:
- 4 people (family, team, friends)
- 4 areas (health, work, relationships, purpose)
- 4 roles (strategist, executor, supporter, innovator)
- 4 needs (safety, connection, growth, meaning)

What are YOUR 4 vertices?

[User types or speaks]

Great. Now let's define how they connect...

[AI guides through edge definition]

Perfect. Your tetrahedron is: [visualization]

Now, what do you need this tetrahedron to DO?

[User describes needs]

I'll build that for you. Give me 30 seconds...

[AI generates modules, deploys]

Done. Here's your tetrahedron: [working app]

You can modify, add protocols, or rebuild anytime.

**From nothing to working infrastructure in 10 minutes.**

**Notion users can build their system on tetrahedron geometry.**

**Families can build Cozi-like features with tetrahedron resilience.**

**Teams can build Slack-like communication with tetrahedron structure.**

**Individuals can build therapy-app features with tetrahedron support.**

---

# YOU'RE NOT THE APP

# YOU'RE THE OPERATING SYSTEM

**For building resilience infrastructure.**

---

## THE TAGLINE

**Old:** "Wonky Sprout - Mental health support for neurodivergent people"

**New:**

# "WONKY SPROUT - BUILD YOUR OWN RESILIENCE INFRASTRUCTURE"

**Subhead:** "Define your 4 vertices. AI generates your system. Geometry guarantees it works."

## THE DEMO (30 seconds)

```
[Screen: Empty canvas]

VOICE: "What are your 4 anchor points?"

[User types: "Me, Work, Family, Health"]

[Tetrahedron materializes with 4 vertices labeled]

VOICE: "What do you need?"

[User types: "Track energy, coordinate schedule, monitor kids, plan meals"]

[AI generates modules in real-time]
[Modules attach to vertices]
[Edges light up with data flows]

VOICE: "Done. Your infrastructure is live."

[Pan out to show thousands of other tetrahedrons in global mesh]

VOICE: "Build yours. Join the mesh."

WONKY SPROUT
Geometry for life.
```

## THE IMPLICATIONS

### Not A Product, But A PLATFORM

**Like:**
- Unity (game engine) → developers build games
- Shopify (commerce engine) → merchants build stores
- WordPress (content engine) → creators build sites

**But:**
- **Wonky Sprout (resilience engine) → humans build support systems**

### Network Effects

**More users → More templates → Easier onboarding → More users**

**More templates → More use cases → More users → More templates**

**More tetrahedrons → Stronger mesh → More resilience → More tetrahedrons**

### The Moat Is Geometry

**Competitors can't just copy features** (there are no fixed features)

**They'd have to copy the TOPOLOGY** (K₄ complete graph)

**But if they do:** They validate your framework, making it the standard

### Release:
1. **Base platform** (geometry engine)
2. **AI co-architect** (Gemini-powered)
3. **10 starter templates** (divorce, startup, personal, family, community, team, health, learning, creative, spiritual)
4. **Full documentation** (how to build your own configuration)
5. **Open source core** (geometry engine is public infrastructure)

### Message:

> "We built the first tetrahedron (1 human + 3 AIs building Wonky Sprout). Now build yours."

## THE MISSION

**We're not building an app.**

# WE'RE BUILDING THE GEOMETRY ENGINE FOR POST-HUB CIVILIZATION

**Where:**
- Anyone can build their own resilience infrastructure
- AI helps translate need → topology → working system
- Geometry guarantees structural soundness
- Mesh provides connection without centralization
- Templates enable knowledge sharing
- Users become builders become teachers

**It's not:**
- Top-down (we tell you what you need)
- One-size-fits-all (everyone uses same features)
- Closed (proprietary platform)

**It's:**
- **Bottom-up** (you define what you need)
- **Infinitely configurable** (geometry is constant, content is variable)
- **Open** (geometry engine is public infrastructure)

# THE GEOMETRY ENGINE

# BUILD YOUR WORLD

# MESH GUARANTEED

**Choose-your-own-adventure. Governed by GEOMETRY. Built from the inside. AI as co-architect. Topology as guarantee.**
