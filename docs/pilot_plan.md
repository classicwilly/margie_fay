# Pilot cohort plan & measurement house

Goal
----
Test the effectiveness of Wonky Sprout OS in helping neurodivergent users increase daily independence and reduce overwhelm. Run a small pilot (N=25) with pre/post measurements.

Key measures
------------
- WHO-5 Well-Being Index (validated mental well-being scale)
- PHQ-2 or PROMIS short scales for mood and functional impairment
- Self-reported independence scale (custom): rate ability to complete daily tasks from 1-10
- Task completion/consistency (app analytics): number of micro-step completions, repeatable SOP use
- Retention & engagement: 7-day retention, weekly active users

Pilot design
------------
1. Recruit 25 participants (mix of ages, genders, and primary neurotypes) over 2 weeks.
2. Baseline survey (WHO-5 + independence scale), install & onboarding, 2-week usage period.
3. Intervention: Use the app for 4 weeks with recommended SOPs and Weekly Review guidance.
4. Post-study survey: Compare pre/post scores on WHO-5 and independence scale, plus qualitative interviews.

Ethics & privacy
----------------
- Collect minimal PII; require explicit consent via `AIConsentModal` and `PIIWarningModal`.
- Anonymize telemetry; only store hashed user id for aggregation.

Deliverables
------------
- Pilot report with pre/post stats, effect sizes, and qualitative themes
- Roadmap items prioritized by advisory board
