## Introduction

### A New Beginning at Forty

At 40 years old, Will Johnson reached a significant inflection point. Retirement from a long
career as an Engineering Technician at the U.S. Department of Defense prompted reevaluation
and introspection. Seeking a formal autism diagnostic evaluation was not an effort to acquire a
label, but to understand a lifetime of lived experience through an explanatory framework.

This narrative consolidates clinical findings and observations, highlighting how a late
diagnosis can validate experience, explain longstanding difficulties, and inform practical
recommendations for daily functioning and mental health support.

## Clinical Summary

This section preserves essential clinical phrasing and findings for clinicians and academic
readers. It includes symptom clusters, standard instrument references, and functional
interpretations.

- Primary diagnosis: Autism Spectrum Disorder (diagnostic instruments & criteria used in the
  clinic report).
- Common co-occurrences: ADHD, GAD (generalized anxiety disorder), major depressive
  symptoms, and a history of substance use.
- Instruments referenced: ABAS-3, clinical history, third-party reports (collateral), and
  standardized interview notes.

## Plain-language summary

This short summary explains the narrative in plain, everyday language. It is intended
for readers who want the essentials without delving into clinical instruments.

- Will’s late autism diagnosis helps explain many of his lifelong social and sensory
  experiences, and his struggles with organization and emotional regulation.
- Co-occurring conditions (ADHD, anxiety, depression) are best treated within an
  integrated, neurodiversity-affirming framework.
- Practical changes — structured routines, clear agendas, and supportive therapy and
  community connections — often improve daily functioning and reduce isolation.

## Timeline

### How to read this timeline

The table below lists notable life events and a concise clinical note for each — it is a
summary, not an exhaustive clinical record.

**Table legend:** Column 1 = approximate age; Column 2 = event/behavior; Column 3 = clinical interpretation or note.

- **Early childhood** — Did not spontaneously imitate, limited gestures and shared affect, avoidant eye contact.
  - Clinical note: Core features compatible with developmental social-communication differences.

- **6** — Set a 10-acre grass fire.
  - Clinical note: Potential high-severity dysregulation, impulsivity — requires contextual exploration.

- **Grade school** — Hated group projects; preferred to do tasks alone.
  - Clinical note: Preference for focused, solitary tasks; reduced social reciprocity.

- **Teen years** — Substance use began; social masking/attempts to fit in.
  - Clinical note: May reflect coping strategies that developed through adolescence.

- **32** — Diagnosed with GAD and depressive symptoms.
  - Clinical note: Secondary mood and anxiety symptoms common with chronic stress and masking.

- **39** — Diagnosed with ADHD.
  - Clinical note: Executive function deficits that can complicate planning and organization.

- **40** — Retirement and autism evaluation.
  - Clinical note: Diagnostic synthesis leads to integrated treatment planning and accommodations.

> Note: For precise clinical information and scoring, consult the original clinical report and assessment instruments.

## Diagnostic Findings

### Social-Communication

- Social-Emotional Reciprocity: Avoids small talk, prefers substantive discussions; may have limited spontaneous reciprocity.
- Nonverbal Communication: Misreading of emotional expressions and practiced eye contact strategies noted.
- Relationships: Mixed evidence; may maintain selective social connections while avoiding close emotional dependency.

### Interests, Repetitive Behaviors, & Sensory Profile

- Repetitive movements and stimming (e.g., leg shaking), preference for repeating media as a form of self-regulation.
- Insistence on sameness and routine; change-related distress commonly observed.
- Highly focused interests (3D printing, CAD, woodworking, electronics) that serve as strengths and coping strategies.

## Masking & Camouflage

Masking behaviors are both present and subtle. Despite self-report of low intentional masking,
observed and collateral evidence suggest systematic compensatory strategies were adopted
across life. Clinically, masking increases internal regulatory burden and raises the risk of
burnout.

## Co-occurring Conditions and Impact

- ADHD: executive function challenges interweave with autism traits; impacts planning and inhibition.
- Anxiety and Depression: often secondary to chronic stress, social fatigue, and unaddressed sensory overload.
- Trauma or PTSD-like symptoms: identified in the clinical history; warrants trauma-informed care.

Key functional domains and clinical implications:

- Work: clear agendas, quiet spaces, and reasonable accommodations are often critical.
- Social: coaching or structured social therapy can support desired functional goals.
- ADLs & Daily routines: environmental cues, visual scheduling, and structured plans promote independence.

## Practical Recommendations

### Actionable next steps (immediate)

- Discuss workplace accommodations with an occupational specialist or HR representative.
- Establish a visual schedule and short focus blocks (e.g., Pomodoro technique).
- Start neurodiversity-affirming therapy and a peer group for social connection.
- Include sleep and sensory planning in a multi-disciplinary care plan.

### Therapy & behavioral supports

- Use affirming therapy that frames neurodiversity as a strength and targets skill-building and acceptance, not purely masking.
- Consider ADHD-specific strategies for executive functioning (coaching, CBT structured for ADHD/autism).

### Harm minimization & substance use

- Respect harm-reduction principles and integrate addiction counseling with neurodiversity-aware therapeutic approaches.

## Actionable checklist

- [ ] Discuss workplace accommodations (written agendas, quiet rooms,
      flexible start times).
- [ ] Start a daily visual schedule and incorporate short Pomodoro-style
      focused work sessions.
- [ ] Consider neurodiversity-affirming therapy and a peer support group.
- [ ] Integrate sleep hygiene and sensory adjustments into a weekly plan.

## Conclusion

### Wholeness and the Power of Knowing

This hybrid document is meant for both clinical readers and general audiences — it
combines the clinical phrasing and diagnostic headings abundant in traditional
clinical write-ups with a plain-language summary and clear, actionable steps to
support day-to-day life. For clinical decisions, consult the complete clinical
evaluation.
