## An Unwritten Script: A Narrative

### Exploration of Will Johnson’s Life — Through the Lens of a Late Autism Diagnosis

> Summary
>
> This narrative synthesizes a clinical evaluation of Will Johnson, exploring how a late
> autism diagnosis reframes a lifetime of experiences — from childhood impulsivity and
> masking strategies to adult co-occurring conditions and coping behaviors. The text offers
> clinical observations and practical recommendations focused on neurodiversity-affirming
> supports.

## Plain-language summary

This short summary explains the narrative in plain, everyday language. It is intended
for readers who want the essentials without delving into clinical instruments.

- Will’s late autism diagnosis helps explain many of his lifelong social and sensory
  experiences, and his struggles with organization and emotional regulation.
- Co-occurring conditions (ADHD, anxiety, depression) are best treated within an
  integrated, neurodiversity-affirming framework.
- Practical changes — structured routines, clear agendas, and supportive therapy and
  community connections — often improve daily functioning and reduce isolation.

## Key Takeaways

- A late diagnosis can provide relief, clarity, and a practical roadmap for supports.
- Routine, predictable structure, and practical aids (timers, visual schedules) help
  with executive function.
- Peer companionship and neurodiversity-affirming mental health care improve
  quality of life and reduce burnout.

## Introduction

### A New Beginning at Forty

At 40 years old, Will Johnson reached a significant inflection point. Retirement from a long
career as an Engineering Technician at the U.S. Department of Defense prompted reevaluation
and introspection. Seeking a formal autism diagnostic evaluation was not an effort to acquire a
label, but to understand a lifetime of lived experience through an explanatory framework.

This narrative consolidates clinical findings and observations, highlighting how a late
diagnosis can validate experience, explain longstanding difficulties, and inform practical
recommendations for daily functioning and mental health support.

## Timeline

### How to read this timeline

The table below lists notable life events and a concise clinical note for each — it is a
summary, not an exhaustive clinical record.

_Table:_ Timeline of key events and clinical notes

**Table legend:** Column 1 = approximate age; Column 2 = event/behavior; Column 3 = clinical interpretation or note.

Below is a structured view of important life events, behaviors, and potential clinical
interpretations that emerged from the diagnostic workup and collateral information.

- **Early childhood** — Did not spontaneously imitate or share enjoyment; avoided eye contact;
  preferred solitary play; strong reactions to noise.
  - Clinical note: Early markers often consistent with social-communication differences.

- **6** — Set a 10-acre grass fire.
  - Clinical note: May reflect severe dysregulation, impulsivity, or sensory seeking; further context required.

- **Grade school** — Hated group projects; preferred to do tasks alone.
  - Clinical note: Consistent with social preference for solitary focused work.

- **Teen years** — Substance use began; social masking/attempts to fit in.
  - Clinical note: May reflect attempts to cope with social anxiety and sensory overload.

- **32** — Diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and depressive disorder.
  - Clinical note: Common co-occurring mental health conditions, often secondary to chronic stress and masking.

- **39** — Diagnosed with ADHD.
  - Clinical note: Executive function deficits (inhibitory control, planning) that interact with autism traits.

- **40** — Retirement and autism evaluation.
  - Clinical note: Opens a pathway for diagnosis, supports, and a neurodiversity-affirming framework.

> Note: This timeline is a condensed summary intended for clinical synthesis rather than
> a full behavioral history. For diagnostic decisions, refer to the full clinical evaluation
> and formal instruments (e.g., ABAS-3, interview notes, third-party reports).

## Diagnostic Findings

### What these findings mean

The sections below summarize the key findings and what they typically mean in
everyday life.

### Social-Communication

- Social-Emotional Reciprocity: Discomfort with small talk; preference for substantive
  discussion; elevated social anxiety in unfamiliar situations.
- Nonverbal Communication: Reports of being "misrepresented"; difficulty interpreting others'
  nonverbal cues; learned eye contact strategies observed (e.g., practicing via video).
- Relationships: Mixed evidence — Will maintains some social contacts but prefers solitude and
  sometimes avoids emotional closeness.

### Interests, Repetitive Behaviors, and Sensory Profile

- Repetitive behaviors: Leg shaking, finger tapping, and preferences for repeated audio or
  video patterns; these appear to function as self-regulatory coping mechanisms.
- Insistence on sameness: Structured daily routines are crucial; disruptions cause distress.
- Intense interests: Deep involvement with 3D printing, CAD, woodworking, and electronics,
  often described as focused and intense.
- Sensory sensitivity: Hypersensitivity to sound, touch, and smell in certain contexts; mixed
  reports across measures but functionally impactful.

## Masking and Camouflage

While Will reports relatively low conscious masking, collateral data and specific behaviors
indicate consistent compensatory strategies. He practices social scripts and eye contact,
often adopting learned behaviors that require cognitive effort. The chronic effort to appear
neurotypical contributes directly to fatigue, anxiety, and increased vulnerability to burnout.

## Co-occurring Conditions and Impact

The diagnosis and co-occurring conditions include ADHD, anxiety, depression, a history of
substance use, and possible trauma-related symptoms. The interplay of these conditions
results in impaired executive functioning, emotional dysregulation, and periods of
functional decline (e.g., a retirement transition with reduced daily structure).

Key functional domains affected — practical impacts

- **Work**: The need for routine, written agendas, and reduced sensory demands is evident;
  clear, written expectations help reduce stress and improve performance.
- **Social**: Social interactions may require effortful scripting and express limited
  spontaneous reciprocity in social-emotional contexts.
- **Daily living**: Executive function challenges raise concerns about planning, organizing,
  and consistent daily execution of tasks.

## Practical Recommendations

### Actionable next steps

Below are recommended next steps to make immediate, practical improvements.

- [ ] Discuss workplace accommodations (written agendas, quiet rooms, flexible start times).
- [ ] Start a daily visual schedule and incorporate short Pomodoro-style focused work sessions.
- [ ] Consider neurodiversity-affirming therapy and a peer support group.
- [ ] Make a plan for next steps with a clinician, e.g., prioritize sleep and structure, and build a follow-up care plan.

### Therapeutic approaches

- Neurodiversity-affirming therapy: Focus should be on accommodation, skill-building, and
  reducing stigma rather than forcing normalization.
- Group supports: Referral to autistic peer groups and community resources for validation and
  shared lived-experience.

### Executive function aids

- Visual schedules, Pomodoro timers, environmental cues, and workplace accommodations
  (written agendas, smaller meetings, quiet spaces).

### Daily living and sleep

- Consistent routines, sleep hygiene practices, and sensory adjustments to the environment
  (cooler, dark bedrooms, reduced evening stimulation).

### Substance use & risk management

- A harm-reduction approach that recognizes substance use as a coping strategy is recommended;
  integrate addiction services with neurodivergent-affirming care.

## Conclusion

### Wholeness and the Power of Knowing

#### How to use this narrative

This document is a synthesis: for clinical decisions, always consult the full evaluation
and a clinician. Use the summaries and recommendations as a starting point for
conversations with clinicians, family, and employers.

## Accessibility note

This document uses short paragraphs, plain-language headings, and a simple timeline table for
readability. If you need a screen-reader-friendly version or large-print copy, reach out to the
care team or repository owner. Ensure any sharing respects privacy and HIPAA-equivalent
practices.

For Will, a late diagnosis provides an explanatory framework — a way to re-interpret past
struggles, reduce self-blame, and pursue tailored interventions. Moving forward, a focus on
strengths, reasonable accommodations, and a supportive community will maximize
resilience and quality of life.
