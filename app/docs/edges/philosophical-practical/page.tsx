            <h2>Living Your Philosophy: When Values Become Daily Practice</h2>
            <p>
              This is different from practical-philosophical (which asks "How do practices embody values?"). This edge asks: <strong>You have a philosophy—now what? How do you translate belief into behavior? How do you make your values REAL?</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              It's about embodied wisdom: Philosophy that walks, not just talks.
            </p>

            <h2>Core Principle: You Don't Have Values, You DO Values</h2>
            <p>
              Values aren't things you possess. They're things you practice. If you say you value kindness but act with cruelty, you don't value kindness—you value something else (efficiency? self-protection? control?).
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>This edge is the integrity check:</strong> Does your life match your stated beliefs? And if not, how do you close the gap?
            </p>

            <h2>The Gap Between Espoused Values and Lived Values</h2>

            <h3>Espoused Values: What You SAY You Believe</h3>
            <p>
              "I value family time." "I believe in self-care." "Relationships are the most important thing."
            </p>

            <h3>Lived Values: What Your ACTIONS Reveal You Believe</h3>
            <p>
              Work comes before dinner. Self-care gets skipped when things get busy. You cancel plans with friends to finish a project.
            </p>

            <h3>The Work: Close the Gap</h3>
            <p>
              Most people lie to themselves about this gap. They say, "I value X, but I'm just too busy/stressed/overwhelmed to live it right now."
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Truth:</strong> You're living your actual values. You just don't like what they are. And that's okay—but you have to be honest about it before you can change it.
            </p>

            <h2>From Philosophy to Practice: The 5-Step Process</h2>

            <h3>Step 1: Name the Value</h3>
            <p>
              What do you SAY you believe? Be specific.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Example:</strong> "I value being present with my kids."
            </p>

            <h3>Step 2: Define What Living It Looks Like</h3>
            <p>
              What would someone SEE if you were living this value?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Example:</strong> "I'd be putting my phone away during dinner. I'd be asking questions and listening to answers. I'd be playing with them instead of cleaning while they play."
            </p>

            <h3>Step 3: Assess Current Reality</h3>
            <p>
              Honestly: Are you doing those things? How often? What's getting in the way?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Example:</strong> "I'm on my phone during dinner 4/7 nights. I ask questions but don't listen because I'm thinking about work. I clean instead of play because mess makes me anxious."
            </p>

            <h3>Step 4: Design One Micro-Practice</h3>
            <p>
              Don't try to overhaul everything. Pick ONE tiny practice that moves you toward the value.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Example:</strong> "Phone goes in the drawer during dinner. Just that. Nothing else changes yet."
            </p>

            <h3>Step 5: Track and Adjust</h3>
            <p>
              Did you do it? What got in the way? What helped? Adjust and try again.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Example:</strong> "Did it 5/7 nights. On nights I didn't, I was expecting an urgent work email. Solution: Check email BEFORE dinner, then put phone away."
            </p>

            <h2>The 7 Phenix Principles—In Daily Life</h2>

            <p>
              Let's take each principle and make it CONCRETE:
            </p>

            <h3>1. Systems Over Individuals: Stop Blaming, Start Pattern-Spotting</h3>

            <p>
              <strong>The belief:</strong> Problems aren't about bad people; they're about patterns.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>The daily practice:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>When you're frustrated with someone, pause. Ask: "What pattern are we caught in?"</li>
              <li>Replace "You always..." with "When X happens, we tend to..."</li>
              <li>In family conflict, map the cycle instead of assigning fault. "When I nag, you shut down. When you shut down, I nag more. We're stuck."</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Change Is Possible: Practice Hope in Small Ways</h3>

            <p>
              <strong>The belief:</strong> People and systems can change.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>The daily practice:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>When you catch yourself thinking "This will never change," stop. Ask: "What would need to shift for this to change even 10%?"</li>
              <li>Celebrate micro-progress. "You only yelled once today instead of three times—that's movement."</li>
              <li>With yourself: Try something new every week, even tiny. (New route to work. Different breakfast. One uncomfortable conversation.) Stay in the practice of change.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Non-Pathologizing: See Behavior as Adaptation, Not Defect</h3>

            <p>
              <strong>The belief:</strong> People make sense in context.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>The daily practice:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>When someone's behavior irritates you, ask: "What might this be protecting them from?" or "What need is this meeting?"</li>
              <li>Replace labels with descriptions. Not "He's controlling" but "He needs predictability because chaos feels dangerous."</li>
              <li>With kids: "You're not bad for hitting. You're struggling with anger. Let's find a better way."</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Relationships as Foundation: Prioritize Connection Over Efficiency</h3>

            <p>
              <strong>The belief:</strong> Relationship quality matters more than task completion.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>The daily practice:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>When you're rushing, pause. Ask: "Will hurrying through this damage the relationship?" If yes, slow down.</li>
              <li>Choose connection over correction. Kid spills milk: You can lecture OR you can say "Oops, let's clean it up together."</li>
              <li>Weekly: Do something purely relational (no agenda, no productivity). Coffee with a friend. Walk with your partner. Floor time with your kid.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5. Context Shapes Everything: Ask "What's Happening Around This?"</h3>

            <p>
              <strong>The belief:</strong> Behavior doesn't happen in a vacuum.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>The daily practice:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>When judging yourself or others, zoom out. "What's the larger context here? (Financial stress? Grief? Transition?)"</li>
              <li>Before intervening, ask: "What's the system around this behavior? What would happen if I changed MY part instead of trying to change theirs?"</li>
              <li>In conflict: "What's going on in your world that I might not know about?" (Invitation to share context.)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>6. Emergence Over Engineering: Trust the Process, Don't Force It</h3>

            <p>
              <strong>The belief:</strong> Solutions emerge; you don't impose them.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>The daily practice:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>When you want to fix something immediately, pause. Ask: "What if I wait and see what emerges?"</li>
              <li>In conversations: Ask more, tell less. "What do you think would help?" instead of "Here's what you should do."</li>
              <li>Let things be messy for a bit. Not every problem needs instant resolution. Sometimes sitting in the tension IS the work.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>7. Both/And Thinking: Hold Paradox Without Collapsing It</h3>

            <p>
              <strong>The belief:</strong> Opposing things can both be true.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>The daily practice:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>When you feel pulled between two things, say it out loud: "I feel both X and Y. Both are real."</li>
              <li>In conflict: Validate both sides before problem-solving. "You need space AND you need connection. How do we honor both?"</li>
              <li>With decisions: Ask "What if both are true? What if neither is entirely right?" Let complexity stay complex.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>When Living Your Values Feels Impossible</h2>

            <h3>Obstacle 1: "I'm Too Tired/Busy/Overwhelmed"</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>The truth:</strong> You're not too busy to live your values. You're too busy living SOMEONE ELSE'S values (your boss's? society's? your family of origin's?).
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>The practice:</strong> Identify ONE thing you can stop doing that doesn't align with your values. Create space for what does.
            </p>

            <h3>Obstacle 2: "Other People Won't Let Me"</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>The truth:</strong> You're probably waiting for permission that will never come. Or you're prioritizing their comfort over your integrity.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>The practice:</strong> Start small and internal. You can't control their response, but you can control YOUR choices. If you value honesty, speak honestly. If they don't like it, that's data—not a reason to abandon your value.
            </p>

            <h3>Obstacle 3: "I Don't Know How"</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>The truth:</strong> You're waiting for perfection. You'll never "know how" fully. You learn by doing.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>The practice:</strong> Take one messy, imperfect step toward your value. Then another. Competence comes through practice, not contemplation.
            </p>

            <h3>Obstacle 4: "It Doesn't Feel Natural Yet"</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>The truth:</strong> Of course it doesn't. You're practicing a NEW value. What feels "natural" is your OLD value (the one you're trying to change).
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>The practice:</strong> Expect awkwardness. Expect discomfort. That's not evidence you're doing it wrong—it's evidence you're growing.
            </p>

            <h2>Building a Values-Driven Life: The Architecture</h2>

            <h3>Daily: Micro-Practices (5 minutes or less)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Morning:</strong> Set one intention based on a value. "Today, I will practice patience."</li>
              <li><strong>Midday:</strong> Check-in. "Am I living my values right now, or am I on autopilot?"</li>
              <li><strong>Evening:</strong> Reflect. "Where did I live my value today? Where did I miss it? What can I learn?"</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Weekly: Review and Adjust (20 minutes)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>What value did I practice well this week?</li>
              <li>What value did I neglect?</li>
              <li>What ONE practice will I commit to next week?</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Monthly: Deeper Assessment (1 hour)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Are my daily actions reflecting my stated values?</li>
              <li>What's the biggest gap between what I say and what I do?</li>
              <li>What needs to change—my values or my actions?</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Quarterly: Values Audit (2-3 hours)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Do my current values still fit who I'm becoming?</li>
              <li>What values am I ready to let go of?</li>
              <li>What new values want to emerge?</li>
              <li>How do I need to restructure my life to support my values?</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Real-World Example: Living "Relationships as Primary"</h2>

            <h3>The Situation:</h3>
            <p>
              A parent says they value "relationships as primary" but finds themselves snapping at their kids constantly, prioritizing chores over connection, and feeling resentful that family time feels like work.
            </p>

            <h3>The Assessment:</h3>
            <p>
              Espoused value: "Relationships are most important."<br/>
              Lived value: "Productivity and control are most important."<br/>
              Gap: Massive.
            </p>

            <h3>The Practice:</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Week 1:</strong> One 10-minute period per day of JUST connection. No cleaning, no correcting, no multitasking. Just play or talk or be together.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Week 2:</strong> When tempted to snap, pause. Ask: "Will saying this strengthen or damage our relationship?" If damage, don't say it. (Or say it differently.)
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Week 3:</strong> Weekly family meeting. 30 minutes. Everyone gets to talk. Agenda includes appreciations + one problem to solve + something fun.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Week 4:</strong> Review. "Do I FEEL more connected to my kids? Do THEY feel more connected to me?" If yes, keep going. If no, adjust.
            </p>

            <h3>The Result:</h3>
            <p>
              After one month: Parent reports feeling less resentful, kids are more cooperative, relationship quality is noticeably better. Not perfect—but REAL progress toward lived value.
            </p>

            <h2>The Both/And of Values and Pragmatism</h2>
            <p>
              You can hold high ideals AND be realistic about human limitations.
            </p>

            <h3>Idealism: "I will always act from my values."</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Pragmatism:</strong> You won't. You'll fail regularly. You're human.
            </p>

            <h3>Both/And: "I am committed to my values AND I will mess up. When I do, I repair and recommit."</h3>
            <p>
              Living your values isn't about perfection. It's about direction. Are you MOSTLY moving toward them? Are you noticing when you drift and course-correcting?
            </p>
            <p>
              That's integrity. Not flawlessness. Integrity.
            </p>

            <h2>The Practice of Philosophical Humility</h2>
            <p>
              As you try to live your values, you'll discover:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Some of your stated values aren't actually yours (they're inherited or imposed)</li>
              <li>Some values conflict with each other (you value both freedom and security—now what?)</li>
              <li>Some values only work in certain contexts (what works in your home doesn't work at work)</li>
              <li>Your values will evolve as you grow (what mattered at 25 might not at 45)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              <strong>This is normal. This is good.</strong> Values aren't static. Living them is an ongoing practice of discernment, adjustment, and growth.
            </p>

            <h2>Integration Questions</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>What's ONE value I SAY I hold that my actions don't reflect? What would need to change?</li>
              <li>If someone watched my life for a week, what would they say I ACTUALLY value?</li>
              <li>What's the smallest practice I could start TODAY that would move me toward one of my values?</li>
              <li>Where am I waiting for conditions to be perfect before I start living my values? What if I started messy?</li>
              <li>What value am I ready to let go of because it's not really mine?</li>
              <li>What new value is emerging that I haven't yet named or claimed?</li>
            </ul>

              <p className="text-sm text-gray-700" style={{margin: 0}}>
                The gap between belief and behavior is where most people live. It's the gap between who you want to be and who you actually are. This edge is about closing that gap—not through willpower or self-criticism, but through patient, persistent practice. Your values aren't something you HAVE. They're something you DO. Day after day. Imperfectly. With repair when you fail. That's what makes them real. That's what makes YOU real. So stop talking about your values. Start walking them. One small step. Then another. That's how philosophy becomes flesh.
