            <h2>Living Your Values: When Daily Actions Reflect Deepest Beliefs</h2>
            <p>
              You have values—things you believe in, principles that matter. But do your daily actions reflect them? This edge is where philosophy becomes incarnate: where you don't just believe in connection, you create daily practices OF connection. Where you don't just value respect, you build routines THROUGH respect.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's the difference between knowing what's right and actually living it.
            </p>

            <h2>Core Principle: Your Life Is Built One Small Action at a Time</h2>
            <p>
              You can't think your way into a value-aligned life. You have to PRACTICE your way there. Every action either moves you toward your values or away from them. Every routine either embodies your principles or contradicts them.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>This edge asks:</strong> Does what you DO match what you SAY you believe?
            </p>

            <h2>Translating Values Into Practices</h2>

            <h3>Value: Connection</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>What it means:</strong> You believe deep relationships matter more than achievements or possessions.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Practices that embody it:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Daily 5-minute one-on-one time with each child (no phones, full attention)</li>
              <li>Weekly date night with partner—protected, non-negotiable</li>
              <li>Turn off phone during dinner—presence over productivity</li>
              <li>Choose "good enough" on housework to have time for play</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong>What undermines it:</strong> Constantly checking email during family time, canceling plans for work, prioritizing clean house over conversation.
            </p>

            <h3>Value: Integrity</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>What it means:</strong> You do what you say you'll do. Your words match your actions.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Practices that embody it:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>When you make a promise to your child, keep it (or explain why you can't and apologize)</li>
              <li>When you set a boundary, enforce it consistently</li>
              <li>When you mess up, own it quickly: "I said I wouldn't yell and I did. I'm sorry."</li>
              <li>When you ask kids to do something, you do it too (no "Do as I say, not as I do")</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong>What undermines it:</strong> Empty threats, inconsistent consequences, asking kids to be honest while you lie about small things.
            </p>

            <h3>Value: Growth</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>What it means:</strong> You believe people can change, learn, become more than they are.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Practices that embody it:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Praise effort not outcomes: "You worked so hard on that" not "You're so smart"</li>
              <li>Normalize mistakes: "What did you learn from that?" not "How could you mess up?"</li>
              <li>Model your own growth: "I'm learning to manage my anger better. Today I did better than yesterday."</li>
              <li>Create "stretch opportunities": Let kids try things slightly beyond their current ability</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong>What undermines it:</strong> Fixed mindset language ("You're just not good at math"), punishing failure, not modeling your own learning.
            </p>

            <h3>Value: Justice/Fairness</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>What it means:</strong> Everyone deserves respect and consideration. Power should be used responsibly.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Practices that embody it:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Give kids age-appropriate voice in decisions that affect them</li>
              <li>Admit when you're wrong, even to your children</li>
              <li>Explain your reasoning when you make rules: "Here's why, even though it feels unfair"</li>
              <li>Notice and address when one child gets more attention/resources than another</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong>What undermines it:</strong> "Because I said so" without explanation, different rules for different kids without good reason, never admitting you're wrong.
            </p>

            <h3>Value: Compassion</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>What it means:</strong> Suffering matters. You respond to others' pain with kindness.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Practices that embody it:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>When child is upset, sit with them before fixing ("You're really sad. I'm here.")</li>
              <li>When partner is struggling, offer help without judgment</li>
              <li>When someone makes a mistake, focus on repair not punishment</li>
              <li>Regularly ask: "What do you need right now?"</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong>What undermines it:</strong> "Suck it up," minimizing feelings, prioritizing convenience over comfort, punishment-focused discipline.
            </p>

            <h2>Building Value-Aligned Routines</h2>

            <h3>The Values Audit</h3>
            <p>
              Take any routine you have. Ask:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>What values does this routine embody?</strong></li>
              <li><strong>What values does it contradict?</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Is this who I want to be?</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Example: Morning Routine Audit</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Current routine:</strong> Yell at kids to get up, rush through breakfast, snap at anyone who's slow, shove them out the door with "Hurry up!"
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Values this embodies:</strong> Efficiency, productivity, timeliness<br/>
              <strong>Values this contradicts:</strong> Connection, compassion, peace
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Question:</strong> Are efficiency and productivity more important than connection and peace in these 30 minutes?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Revised routine aligned with connection/compassion:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Set alarm 15 min earlier to reduce rush</li>
              <li>Wake kids with touch not yelling</li>
              <li>One moment of connection at breakfast ("What's one thing you're looking forward to today?")</li>
              <li>Goodbye includes "I love you" not "Hurry up"</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Still get out the door on time, but the EXPERIENCE aligns with your values.
            </p>

            <h2>Rituals That Embody Meaning</h2>
            <p>
              Rituals are practices with intention. They mark what's sacred, what matters.
            </p>

            <h3>Ritual 1: The Gratitude Practice</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Value it embodies:</strong> Abundance, appreciation, perspective<br/>
              <strong>How:</strong> Each night at dinner, everyone shares one thing they're grateful for<br/>
              <strong>Why it works:</strong> Trains attention toward what's good, creates positive shared experience
            </p>

            <h3>Ritual 2: The Family Blessing</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Value it embodies:</strong> Belonging, affirmation, love<br/>
              <strong>How:</strong> Monthly (or weekly), each person says one thing they appreciate about each other person<br/>
              <strong>Why it works:</strong> Makes love tangible, builds emotional safety
            </p>

            <h3>Ritual 3: The Mistake Celebration</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Value it embodies:</strong> Growth, resilience, non-perfectionism<br/>
              <strong>How:</strong> Weekly, each person shares one mistake they made and what they learned<br/>
              <strong>Why it works:</strong> Normalizes failure, encourages risk-taking, models vulnerability
            </p>

            <h3>Ritual 4: The Acts of Service Day</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Value it embodies:</strong> Contribution, compassion, stewardship<br/>
              <strong>How:</strong> Monthly, family volunteers together or does something kind for neighbor<br/>
              <strong>Why it works:</strong> Values become action, kids see beyond themselves
            </p>

            <h2>When Your Practices Betray Your Values</h2>

            <h3>Common Misalignments:</h3>

            <p>
              <strong>You value presence, but you're always on your phone.</strong><br/>
              <em>Fix:</em> Create phone-free zones (dinner table, bedtime) and keep them sacred.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>You value honesty, but you lie to your kids about small things.</strong><br/>
              <em>Fix:</em> Commit to truth-telling even when inconvenient: "I don't want to go either, but we said we would."
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>You value respect, but you talk to your kids in ways you'd never talk to a friend.</strong><br/>
              <em>Fix:</em> Notice your tone. Would you speak to a colleague this way? If not, don't speak to your child this way.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>You value rest, but you're always busy and stressed.</strong><br/>
              <em>Fix:</em> Schedule rest like it's a meeting. Protect it. Model it for your kids.
            </p>

            <h2>Practices for Living Your Philosophy</h2>

            <h3>Practice 1: The Daily Reflection</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Time:</strong> 5 minutes before bed<br/>
              <strong>Questions:</strong><br/>
              - Did my actions today reflect my values?<br/>
              - Where did I live with integrity?<br/>
              - Where did I fall short?<br/>
              - What will I do differently tomorrow?
            </p>

            <h3>Practice 2: The Quarterly Values Check-In</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Time:</strong> 1 hour every 3 months<br/>
              <strong>Process:</strong><br/>
              - List your top 5 values<br/>
              - For each, rate 1-10: How well am I living this?<br/>
              - Identify one practice to strengthen each value<br/>
              - Set reminders to implement
            </p>

            <h3>Practice 3: The Family Mission Statement</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Create together:</strong> What kind of family do we want to be?<br/>
              <strong>Write it down:</strong> Keep it visible<br/>
              <strong>Return to it:</strong> When making decisions, ask "Does this align with who we said we want to be?"
            </p>

            <h2>Teaching Values Through Practice (Not Lectures)</h2>
            <p>
              Kids don't learn values from what you SAY. They learn from what you DO.
            </p>

            <h3>Value: Generosity</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Don't:</strong> Lecture about how important it is to give to others<br/>
              <strong>Do:</strong> Regularly practice giving together (donate toys, help neighbor, tip generously and explain why)
            </p>

            <h3>Value: Resilience</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Don't:</strong> Tell kids to "tough it out" when things are hard<br/>
              <strong>Do:</strong> Model your own resilience out loud: "This is hard. I'm frustrated. But I'm going to keep trying."
            </p>

            <h3>Value: Humility</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Don't:</strong> Insist you're always right and never admit mistakes<br/>
              <strong>Do:</strong> Apologize when you're wrong: "I messed up. I'm sorry. Here's what I'll do differently."
            </p>

            <h2>The Integrity Test</h2>
            <p>
              Want to know if you're living your values? Ask yourself:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Would I be proud if my actions were public?</strong> (If not, they're not aligned)</li>
              <li><strong>Would I want my kids to do what I'm doing?</strong> (If not, change it)</li>
              <li><strong>Does this align with who I say I am?</strong> (If not, either change the action or change the claim)</li>
              <li><strong>Will I look back on this and feel good?</strong> (If not, you're betraying future-you)</li>
            </ul>

            <div className="mt-8 p-6 bg-linear-to-r from-green-50 to-amber-50 rounded-lg">
              <p className="text-sm font-medium text-gray-800" style={{marginBottom: '0.5rem'}}>🔆 <strong>You Are What You Practice</strong></p>
              <p className="text-sm text-gray-700" style={{margin: 0}}>
                You don't become a person of integrity by deciding to value integrity. You become a person of integrity by PRACTICING integrity daily—keeping small promises, admitting small mistakes, making small choices that align. Your life is not your intentions or your beliefs. Your life is your actions, repeated. Choose practices that make you who you want to be.
