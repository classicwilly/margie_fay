# WORK TETRAHEDRON

**Career resilience mesh. Boss as bottleneck is dead.**

---

## The Problem: Work Hub-and-Spoke Collapse

### Current System = Single Point of Failure

**Boss as hub:**
- Boss toxic → your job becomes hell
- Boss leaves → your projects die
- Boss plays favorites → you're invisible
- Boss doesn't advocate → you're passed over for promotion
- Boss gets laid off → you're next

**Result: CASCADE COLLAPSE**

You can't do your job → stress increases → performance suffers → you get fired or quit → income stops → family crisis → Memorial Fund activates.

**The bottleneck kills careers.**

---

## Hub-and-Spoke Work Failures

### 1. Boss Overwhelmed
**1 manager, 12 direct reports.**
- Cannot give individualized career development
- Misses your burnout signals
- No time for mentorship
- Only sees you during crisis (performance review)
- Promotion decisions made without context

### 2. Peer Isolation
**Everyone competing, no one collaborating.**
- Can't ask for help (will look weak)
- Don't share knowledge (hoarding = job security)
- No one to cover when you're sick
- Toxic comparison culture
- Layoffs pit you against colleagues

### 3. No Income Stability
**One job loss = financial catastrophe.**
- All eggs in one basket (one employer)
- Severance only lasts 2-3 months
- Unemployment doesn't cover bills
- Savings depleted in 60 days
- Shame prevents asking for help

### 4. Burnout Invisible Until Breakdown
**No one sees it coming.**
- Working 60-hour weeks (normalized)
- Sleep deteriorating (pushed through)
- Anxiety increasing (white-knuckled)
- Physical symptoms (ignored)
- Then: Breakdown, medical leave, or quit without plan

### 5. Career Transitions Terrifying
**Pivot alone in the dark.**
- No idea what skills transfer
- No network in new industry
- Imposter syndrome paralysis
- Can't afford to fail (bills don't stop)
- Give up, stay in soul-crushing job

**The hub fails → career dies → income stops → you believe you're unemployable.**

## The Solution: Work Mesh

### Complete K₄ Graph for Career Resilience

**4 Vertices (Work Tetrahedron):**
1. **You** (blue) - Own your career data, track skills/burnout/goals
2. **Manager/Boss** (green) - Provides resources, removes blockers, advocates
3. **Mentor/Advisor** (purple) - Career guidance, industry perspective, long-term strategy
4. **Peer/Colleague** (amber) - Collaboration, skill exchange, mutual support

**6 Edges (Support Flows):**
1. **You ↔ Manager**: Daily work coordination, resource requests, performance feedback
2. **You ↔ Mentor**: Career strategy, skill development, industry navigation
3. **You ↔ Peer**: Knowledge sharing, collaboration, emotional support
4. **Manager ↔ Mentor**: Your career development alignment, advocacy coordination
5. **Manager ↔ Peer**: Team collaboration, project coordination, skill visibility
6. **Mentor ↔ Peer**: Industry connections, skill validation, opportunity awareness

**NO SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE.**

When boss toxic → Mentor and Peer see it, help you navigate or exit safely.  
When burnout approaching → All 3 adults see early signs, coordinate intervention.  
When layoff coming → Manager/Mentor/Peer mobilize network, you land softly.

**The mesh catches you.**

## 4 Work Tetrahedron Configurations

### Configuration 1: Employee Support Mesh
**Standard full-time employment**

**Vertices:**
- 💼 **You** (blue): Track projects, skills gained, burnout signals, career goals
- 👔 **Manager** (green): Provides resources, removes blockers, advocates for promotion
- 🎯 **Mentor** (purple): Senior person (inside or outside company), career strategy
- 🤝 **Peer Ally** (amber): Colleague at similar level, mutual support and skill exchange

**Use Case:**
Software engineer at tech company. Manager focused on shipping features (short-term). Mentor (senior engineer at different company) guides long-term career (should you specialize or go management?). Peer Ally (fellow engineer) collaborates on projects, covers when you're out sick, vouches for your skills during layoffs.

**Guardian Node:**
- Monitors: Work hours (creeping up?), meeting load (too many?), code commits (slowing down?), Slack response time (always on?), sleep quality (via wearable), mood (daily check-in)
- Detects: Burnout approaching (60+ hour weeks for 4 weeks straight, sleep down 2 hours, mood "stressed" every day, peer says "you seem exhausted")
- Alerts: All 4 vertices (you + manager + mentor + peer) when burnout risk detected
- Suggests: Take PTO, delegate projects, decline meetings, therapy check-in, reduce scope

**Memorial Fund Integration:**
- Layoff bridge ($15K for 3 months rent/bills while job hunting)
- Medical equipment ($1,200 ergonomic desk setup for chronic pain)
- Professional development ($2,000 conference/certification when company won't pay)
- Emergency childcare ($500 when daycare closes, can't miss work)

---

### Configuration 2: Freelancer Collective
**Revenue sharing, mutual support**

**Vertices:**
- 💼 **Freelancer 1** (blue): Web developer, React specialist
- 💼 **Freelancer 2** (green): Designer, brand identity expert
- 💼 **Freelancer 3** (purple): Copywriter, content strategist
- 💼 **Freelancer 4** (amber): Project manager, client relations

**Use Case:**
4 freelancers form revenue-sharing collective. When web developer lands big client, designer and copywriter collaborate (split revenue 40/30/20/10, PM gets 10% for coordination). When designer has slow month, others' projects keep income flowing. No more feast/famine.

**Skills Overlap:**
- Web dev knows basic design → can cover designer's vacation
- Designer writes decent copy → can cover copywriter's sick day
- Copywriter manages client relationships → can cover PM's parental leave
- PM understands web tech → can scope projects when dev slammed

**Guardian Node:**
- Monitors: Revenue pipeline (booked work next 60 days), client health (payment delays, scope creep), workload balance (is one person overwhelmed?), skills gaps (need to hire specialist?)
- Detects: Income cliff (no new clients booked, 30 days runway), burnout (one person doing 60% of work), client risk (late payments, red flags)
- Alerts: All 4 freelancers when intervention needed
- Suggests: Sales push (everyone pitch), revenue redistribution (person with time picks up sales), fire toxic client, hire contractor

**Memorial Fund Integration:**
- Slow month gap ($3K when no clients, covers health insurance + rent)
- Equipment failure ($2,500 laptop died, need to work)
- Client didn't pay ($8K invoice 90 days overdue, need bridge)
- Health crisis ($5K when freelancer can't work for 6 weeks, no disability insurance)

---

### Configuration 3: Startup Co-founder Mesh
**Prevent founder burnout and conflict**

**Vertices:**
- 💼 **CEO** (blue): Vision, fundraising, external relationships
- 💼 **CTO** (green): Product, engineering, technical decisions
- 💼 **COO** (purple): Operations, team, execution
- 💼 **CFO** (amber): Finance, legal, compliance

**Use Case:**
4 co-founders building SaaS startup. Classic conflict: CEO wants to pivot, CTO thinks current product almost works, COO exhausted from hiring chaos, CFO worried about runway. Without mesh: co-founders fight, startup dies. With mesh: structured conflict resolution, data-driven decisions, Guardian Node detects when someone burning out.

**Co-founder Protocols:**
- Weekly sync (4 co-founders, what's working/not working)
- Monthly retros (process improvement, conflict resolution)
- Quarterly strategy (pivot? Persevere? Change roles?)
- Real-time burnout tracking (who's at risk?)

**Guardian Node:**
- Monitors: Work hours (who's doing 80-hour weeks?), stress levels (daily check-in), co-founder conflict (tone analysis in Slack), runway (how many months left?), key metrics (growth, churn, revenue)
- Detects: Founder burnout (one person always stressed, working weekends, not delegating), co-founder conflict brewing (short responses, avoiding meetings, passive-aggressive comments), pivot moment (metrics not improving despite effort)
- Alerts: All 4 co-founders when crisis detected
- Suggests: Redistribute responsibilities, hire to relieve bottleneck, structured conflict resolution, take vacation, pivot or shut down

**Memorial Fund Integration:**
- Founder took no salary for 6 months ($18K to cover rent while startup finds PMF)
- Medical crisis (founder needs surgery, startup can't afford temp replacement: $10K)
- Runway gap ($25K bridge loan when investor wires funds late, payroll due)

---

### Configuration 4: Career Transition Pod
**Navigate industry change, skill pivot**

**Vertices:**
- 💼 **You** (blue): Transitioning from teaching to UX design (skills transferable but unknown)
- 🎯 **Career Coach** (green): Guides resume, portfolio, interview prep, salary negotiation
- 🏢 **Industry Contact** (purple): UX designer at target company, insider perspective on what hiring managers want
- 🤝 **Accountability Partner** (amber): Someone also career transitioning (supports emotionally, shares job leads, practices interviews)

**Use Case:**
Teacher burned out, wants to pivot to UX design. Has transferable skills (empathy, communication, understanding user needs) but doesn't know how to translate "taught 5th grade" into "designed user experiences." Career Coach helps reframe resume. Industry Contact reviews portfolio, suggests improvements. Accountability Partner prevents isolation and imposter syndrome spiral.

**Transition Milestones:**
- Skills inventory (what transfers? What to learn?)
- Portfolio projects (3 case studies showing UX process)
- Network building (50 LinkedIn connections in target industry)
- Applications (20/week, track response rate)
- Interviews (prepare for common questions, salary negotiation)

**Guardian Node:**
- Monitors: Application response rate (sending resumes into void?), interview conversion (getting interviews but not offers?), skill gaps (missing key requirement?), financial runway (savings depleting), emotional state (imposter syndrome, giving up?)
- Detects: Application strategy not working (100 sent, 0 responses = resume problem), interview performance issue (5 interviews, 0 offers = need practice), skill gap (keeps hearing "need more X experience"), financial crisis (runway down to 30 days), imposter syndrome spiral (stopping applications, avoiding networking)
- Alerts: All 4 vertices when pivot at risk
- Suggests: Resume overhaul, portfolio improvements, practice interviews, take freelance gig (skill-building + income), therapy (imposter syndrome), extend runway (Memorial Fund)

**Memorial Fund Integration:**
- Career transition runway ($8K for 2 months rent while job hunting)
- Bootcamp/certification ($3,500 UX design course to fill skill gap)
- Networking event travel ($800 to attend conference in target industry)
- Portfolio work ($1,200 to hire developer to build portfolio site)

## Core Modules

### Module 1: Skills Tracker
**What you know, what you're learning, what you need.**

**Features:**
- Skills inventory (hard skills: Python, Figma; soft skills: communication, leadership)
- Proficiency levels (beginner → intermediate → advanced → expert)
- Skills in demand (what employers want in your role/industry)
- Skills you're building (online courses, side projects, on-the-job learning)
- Skills gap analysis (what's blocking your next career move?)

**All Vertices See:**
- **You**: Know what to prioritize learning
- **Manager**: Assign projects that build skills you need
- **Mentor**: Guide skill development strategy (broad vs specialized)
- **Peer**: Skill exchange (I teach you X, you teach me Y)

**Example:**
```
CURRENT SKILLS:
✅ React (Expert): 5 years, built 20+ production apps
✅ TypeScript (Advanced): 3 years, type-safe across codebase
✅ CSS (Advanced): Can build anything from design mockups
🟡 Node.js (Intermediate): Built APIs, need more backend depth
🟡 System design (Intermediate): Can design small systems, need scale experience

TARGET ROLE: Senior Frontend Engineer
SKILLS NEEDED:
✅ React (Expert) ← Already have
✅ TypeScript (Advanced) ← Already have
❌ Performance optimization (Need: Advanced, Have: Beginner)
❌ Mentoring junior engineers (Need: Intermediate, Have: None)
❌ Cross-functional collaboration (Need: Advanced, Have: Intermediate)

ACTION PLAN:
- Take performance course (Frontend Masters)
- Mentor 1 junior dev (ask manager to assign)
- Lead project with design/product (build collaboration skill)
```

**Guardian Node:**
- Detects: Skills stagnating (no new skills learned in 12 months = career risk)
- Alerts: Time to upskill (industry shifting, your skills becoming obsolete)
- Suggests: Courses, projects, mentorship opportunities

---

### Module 2: Burnout Monitor
**Early warning system before breakdown.**

**Tracked Metrics:**
- Work hours per week (creeping up from 40 to 50 to 60?)
- Meeting load (how much time in meetings vs deep work?)
- Sleep quality (via wearable or self-report)
- Mood check-ins (daily: energized/neutral/stressed/exhausted)
- Physical symptoms (headaches, back pain, digestive issues)
- Weekend work (are you recovering or always on?)
- PTO usage (when's the last time you took a day off?)

**Burnout Risk Calculation:**
```
HEALTHY BASELINE (Your Normal):
- Work hours: 42/week
- Meetings: 12 hours/week
- Sleep: 7.5 hours/night
- Mood: "neutral" to "energized" most days
- PTO: 2 days/month

CURRENT STATE (This Month):
- Work hours: 58/week (↑38%)
- Meetings: 22 hours/week (↑83%)
- Sleep: 6 hours/night (↓20%)
- Mood: "stressed" 18/22 workdays
- PTO: 0 days

⚠️ BURNOUT RISK: HIGH
- Hours unsustainable (58/week for 4 weeks = crash coming)
- Sleep deficit accumulating (10.5 hours/week shortage)
- Mood deteriorating (stressed 82% of time)
- No recovery time (0 PTO, working weekends)

ALERT SENT TO: You, Manager, Mentor, Peer Ally
```

**All Vertices See Data:**
- **Manager**: "I see you're at burnout risk. What can I take off your plate? Should we push the deadline?"
- **Mentor**: "This pace is unsustainable. You need to set boundaries or you'll crash. Let's strategize."
- **Peer**: "I can cover the client meeting Thursday so you can take a mental health day. Just rest."
- **You**: "Oh shit, I didn't realize I was this close to the edge. I need to change something NOW."

**Guardian Node:**
- Monitors: All metrics above, trends over time
- Detects: Burnout risk (metrics deteriorating for 3+ weeks), imminent crash (sleep <5 hours, working 7 days/week, mood "exhausted")
- Alerts: All 4 vertices with specific recommendations
- Suggests: Take PTO, delegate projects, decline meetings, reduce scope, talk to therapist, medical leave if needed

---

### Module 3: Project Portfolio
**Show what you've built, what you've learned.**

**Features:**
- Project cards (name, role, skills used, impact/results, artifacts)
- Skills gained per project (what did you learn?)
- Quantifiable impact (increased revenue 15%, reduced load time 40%, saved 20 hours/week)
- Collaboration highlights (who you worked with, how you led)
- Portfolio website generator (auto-creates portfolio from project data)

**Why This Matters:**
- Resume bullets are boring ("Built web app") → Project portfolio shows the work
- Interviews ask "tell me about a time..." → You have specific examples ready
- Promotions require proof → You have quantified impact data
- Job hunting easier → Send portfolio link, stand out from 100 other resumes

**Example Project Card:**
```
PROJECT: E-commerce Redesign
ROLE: Lead Frontend Engineer
DATES: Jan-June 2024
TEAM: 1 designer, 2 engineers, 1 PM

SKILLS USED:
- React, TypeScript, Next.js (frontend)
- Figma (design collaboration)
- A/B testing (data-driven decisions)
- Cross-functional communication

CHALLENGES:
- Legacy codebase (jQuery → React migration)
- Tight deadline (6 months for full redesign)
- Performance goals (sub-2-second load time)

SOLUTIONS:
- Incremental migration strategy (new pages in React, old pages in jQuery during transition)
- Code splitting + lazy loading (reduced bundle size 60%)
- Weekly design/eng syncs (caught issues early, avoided rework)

IMPACT:
- Conversion rate: +22% (from 2.4% to 2.9%)
- Page load time: 4.2s → 1.8s (57% improvement)
- Mobile bounce rate: -18%
- Revenue impact: +$1.2M/year

ARTIFACTS:
- [Live site](https://example.com)
- [Case study](https://portfolio.com/ecommerce)
- [Performance report](https://portfolio.com/perf-metrics)
```

**All Vertices See:**
- **Manager**: "Wow, I didn't realize the revenue impact was that big. I'm using this in your promotion packet."
- **Mentor**: "Great quantifiable results. You need to talk about this in interviews. Practice the story."
- **Peer**: "Can I use your migration strategy for my legacy project? This is exactly what I need."
- **You**: "I have proof of my impact. I'm not just 'a good engineer,' I'm an engineer who increased revenue $1.2M."

---

### Module 4: Network Map
**Your professional relationships, visualized.**

**Features:**
- Contact cards (name, role, company, how you know them, last contact)
- Relationship strength (strong/medium/weak)
- Potential value (can they help you? can you help them?)
- Touch-point reminders ("Reach out to Alex, you haven't talked in 6 months")
- Introduction pathways ("You want to work at Google? Maria knows 3 hiring managers there.")

**Network Health Metrics:**
- Total contacts: 150
- Strong relationships: 12 (talk monthly or more)
- Medium relationships: 45 (talk quarterly)
- Weak relationships: 93 (connected but rarely talk)
- Cold contacts: 20 (haven't talked in 2+ years, need re-engagement)

**Guardian Node:**
- Detects: Network atrophy (strong relationships declining to medium, no new contacts in 6 months)
- Alerts: "Your network is weakening. Reach out to 3 people this week."
- Suggests: Coffee chats, LinkedIn comments, email check-ins, introduce two people

**Use Cases:**
- **Job hunting**: Filter contacts by target company, ask for referrals
- **Skill learning**: Who knows the skill you're learning? Ask for advice
- **Career pivot**: Who's in your target industry? Informational interviews
- **Promotion**: Who can vouch for your work? Ask manager to talk to them

---

**Where you're going, how you'll get there.**

**Features:**
- North Star goal (where do you want to be in 5 years?)
- Milestones (what needs to happen to get there?)
- Skills to build (what capabilities do you need?)
- Experience to gain (what projects/roles?)
- Timeline (realistic dates, not fantasies)

**Example Roadmap:**
```
NORTH STAR (5 years):
Senior Engineering Manager at top tech company, leading 20-person team, $250K+ comp

CURRENT STATE (Now):
Mid-level engineer, 5 years experience, individual contributor, $120K comp

MILESTONE 1 (1 year): Senior Engineer
- Skills: System design (advanced), mentoring (intermediate)
- Experience: Lead 2 major projects, mentor 2 junior engineers
- Advocacy: Manager nominates for promotion, mentor provides letter

MILESTONE 2 (2 years): Staff Engineer or Engineering Manager (choose path)
- Skills: If staff → deep technical expertise; If manager → people management
- Experience: If staff → architect major system; If manager → lead team of 3-5
- Decision point: Do I want to stay technical or go management?

MILESTONE 3 (3-4 years): Senior EM (if management path)
- Skills: Hiring, performance management, strategy, cross-functional leadership
- Experience: Grow team from 5 to 15, ship major product, manage managers
- Advocacy: VP sponsor

MILESTONE 4 (5 years): Senior EM at target company
- Application: Portfolio shows impact, network provides referrals
- Interview: Stories ready, salary negotiation practiced
- Comp: $250K+ (base + bonus + equity)
```

**All Vertices Review:**
- **Manager**: "This is realistic. Let me assign projects that build the skills you need."
- **Mentor**: "Year 2 decision (technical vs management) is critical. Let's discuss trade-offs."
- **Peer**: "If you go management, can I be on your team? I'd love to work for you."
- **You**: "I have a plan. I know what to focus on. I'm not just drifting."

**Guardian Node:**
- Monitors: Progress toward milestones (on track? Slipping?)
- Detects: Roadmap stalled (no progress in 6 months), goals misaligned (company can't provide the experience you need)
- Alerts: Time to adjust plan or change companies
- Suggests: New projects, mentorship, job change

---

### Module 6: Income Stability Dashboard
**Track runway, diversify income, plan for gaps.**

**Features:**
- Primary income (salary/freelance revenue)
- Secondary income (side hustle, investments, passive income)
- Expenses (monthly burn rate)
- Runway (how many months can you survive without income?)
- Income sources diversity (all eggs in one basket?)

**Freelancer Example:**
```
CURRENT MONTH:
Primary income (client projects): $8,500
Secondary income (course sales): $400
Total: $8,900

Expenses: $5,200/month
Savings: $15,000
Runway: 2.9 months (if all income stops)

INCOME DIVERSITY RISK: HIGH
- 95% from client projects (all eggs in one basket)
- Only 2 active clients (if one leaves, income drops 50%)
- No recurring revenue (every month is new sales)

PIPELINE:
Next 30 days: $6,000 booked (71% of target)
Next 60 days: $2,500 booked (15% of target)
Next 90 days: $0 booked (0% of target)

⚠️ INCOME CLIFF DETECTED
- Need to close $15,000 in next 60 days
- Current pace: Will hit $0 revenue in 90 days
- Runway: Only 2.9 months savings

ALERT SENT TO: All 4 vertices (Freelancer Collective)
```

**Collective Response:**
- **Freelancer 2**: "I can refer you to 3 potential clients I'm too busy for right now."
- **Freelancer 3**: "Want to collaborate on my client's project? Split 60/40, gives you $3K and fills your pipeline."
- **Freelancer 4**: "Let's do a sales sprint. Everyone pitch 5 clients this week. We need to fill the pipeline."
- **Memorial Fund**: "If you can't close clients in 30 days, we'll cover your $5K/month expenses for 2 months while you pivot."

**Guardian Node:**
- Monitors: Income trends, pipeline health, runway
- Detects: Income cliff (pipeline empty), overconcentration (1 client = 80% of revenue), runway crisis (<60 days)
- Alerts: All vertices + Memorial Fund if needed
- Suggests: Sales push, diversify clients, cut expenses, emergency fund activation

---

### Module 7: Toxic Workplace Detector

## Guardian Node: AI Career Coordinator

### Burnout Detection

**Early Warning Signs:**
- Work hours creeping up (40 → 45 → 50 → 55 hours/week over 8 weeks)
- Sleep deteriorating (7.5 → 7 → 6.5 → 6 hours/night)
- Mood declining ("neutral" → "stressed" → "exhausted" over time)
- PTO not taken (used to take 2 days/month, now 0 days for 3 months)
- Physical symptoms increasing (headaches 1x/week → 3x/week)
- Weekend work normalizing (worked Saturday 4 weeks in a row)

**Alert Sent to All 4 Vertices:**
```
⚠️ BURNOUT CRISIS DETECTED

Person: Jordan (Software Engineer)
Issue: Unsustainable work pace for 8 weeks, physical/emotional deterioration

DATA:
- Work hours: 40/week → 58/week (↑45% over 8 weeks)
- Sleep: 7.5 hours → 6 hours (↓20%)
- Mood: "stressed" 19/22 workdays (86% of time)
- PTO: 0 days in 12 weeks (usually 2 days/month)
- Physical: Headaches 3x/week, back pain daily
- Weekend work: 4 consecutive Saturdays (no recovery time)

BURNOUT RISK: IMMINENT (crash likely within 2 weeks)

INTERVENTION REQUIRED:
- Manager: Reduce scope immediately, push deadline, or reassign projects. Jordan needs 20 hours/week freed up.
- Mentor: This is unsustainable. Jordan needs to set boundaries or leave. Coach on saying no.
- Peer: Offer to cover Jordan's meeting on Friday so they can take a mental health day. Just rest.
- Jordan: You're going to crash. Take 3 days off THIS WEEK. Non-negotiable.

TIMELINE:
- Act within 48 hours (crisis compounding)
- Reassess in 1 week (are hours down? Is sleep improving?)
- If no improvement: Medical leave or job change required
```

**All 4 vertices coordinate response.**

### Layoff Risk Prediction

**Risk Factors:**
- Company financials (revenue down, funding running out)
- Your role redundancy (could your work be automated/outsourced?)
- Performance signals (passed over for projects, less visibility)
- Org changes (new manager, team restructure, budget cuts)
- Industry trends (mass layoffs at competitor companies)

**Layoff Risk Score:**
```
LAYOFF RISK ASSESSMENT: Jordan

COMPANY HEALTH (High Risk):
- Revenue miss: 15% below target last quarter
- Hiring freeze: Announced 2 months ago
- Exec departures: CFO and VP Eng left in 6 months
- Budget cuts: 10% reduction across departments

ROLE VULNERABILITY (Medium Risk):
- Redundancy: 3 other engineers with similar skillset
- Project impact: Recent projects not tied to revenue
- Visibility: Not working on strategic initiatives
- Performance: Solid but not standout

EARLY WARNING SIGNS (High Risk):
- Excluded from meetings (used to be in planning, now just execution)
- Manager distant (1-on-1s canceled 2x last month)
- Scope reduction (fewer projects assigned)
- Peer rumors (3 people mentioned layoffs might be coming)

LAYOFF RISK: 65% (likely within 6 months)

RECOMMENDATION: Activate exit strategy NOW
- Update resume this week
- Apply to 10 jobs/week minimum
- Activate network (reach out to 20 contacts)
- Financial prep (reduce expenses, build 6-month runway)
- Document wins (for interview stories + severance negotiation)
```

**Alert Sent to All Vertices:**
```
⚠️ LAYOFF RISK: 65%

Action plan:
- Manager: Continue doing good work, don't let performance slip (severance eligibility)
- Mentor: Activate job search immediately, this is not a drill
- Peer: Network mobilization, send referrals for open roles
- Memorial Fund: Standing by, if laid off we'll cover $15K for 3 months
```

**Outcome:**
- Jordan applies to 40 jobs over 6 weeks
- Gets 3 offers (Mentor helped negotiate)
- Accepts new job (+$20K salary)
- Company announces layoffs 2 weeks after Jordan leaves
- Jordan's whole team cut (but Jordan already safe)

**EARLY DETECTION = LAND ON YOUR FEET INSTEAD OF CRASH**

### Income Cliff Detection (Freelancers)

**Risk Signals:**
- Pipeline empty (no new clients booked in 60 days)
- Client concentration (80% of revenue from 1 client)
- Revenue declining (down 30% over 3 months)
- Runway shrinking (savings depleting, 90 days → 60 days → 30 days)
- Outreach slowing (fewer pitches sent, giving up?)

**Alert Sent to Freelancer Collective:**
```
⚠️ INCOME CLIFF DETECTED: Freelancer 3

DATA:
- Pipeline: $0 booked next 90 days (normally $15K-20K)
- Current projects: 1 client, ending in 30 days
- Revenue trend: $12K → $8K → $5K (down 58% in 3 months)

## Memorial Fund Integration: Work Crisis

### When Work Crisis Detected:

**Guardian Node Triggers:**
1. Layoff (immediate income stop, need bridge funds)
2. Medical leave (short-term disability doesn't cover expenses)
3. Toxic workplace exit (need to quit for mental health before new job lined up)
4. Freelance income cliff (no clients, runway exhausted)
5. Career transition (need time/money to upskill, can't work and learn simultaneously)
6. Equipment failure (laptop died, can't work without it)

**Automatic Memorial Fund Activation:**
```
WORK CRISIS: Jordan - Laid Off

NEED: $15,000
- Rent: $2,000/month × 3 months = $6,000
- Bills: $1,500/month × 3 months = $4,500
- Health insurance (COBRA): $600/month × 3 months = $1,800
- Job search costs: $700 (professional resume, LinkedIn Premium, interview clothes)
- Emergency buffer: $2,000

REASON:
Jordan laid off in tech industry downturn (company cut 30% of staff). Severance: 2 weeks (not enough). Unemployment: $450/week (doesn't cover bills). Savings: $3,000 (covers 2 weeks). Without Memorial Fund: homeless in 60 days or forced to take first terrible offer.

IMPACT IF FUNDED:
- 3 months runway (can find RIGHT job, not desperate job)
- Health insurance maintained (no gap in coverage)
- Professional job search (resume, coaching, networking)
- Land 40% higher salary (negotiating from position of strength, not desperation)
- No credit card debt (would've carried $15K balance for years)

MESH: 60-person work tetrahedron (colleagues, clients, friends)
CONTRIBUTIONS: $50 - $1,000 per person
TARGET: Raise $15,000 in 72 hours
```

**Contribution Portal Opens:**
- All 60 people in Jordan's mesh notified
- Give directly (funds released to Jordan, rent paid)
- Progress bar updates live
- Funds cover 3 months, Jordan lands new job in 8 weeks

**Result:**
- $17,200 raised in 48 hours (58 contributors)
- Jordan takes 2 weeks to rest (burnout recovery)
- Spends 6 weeks focused job search (not desperate, selective)
- Gets 3 offers (can negotiate)
- Accepts role at $140K (was $110K before layoff, 27% increase)
- Says: "Without the mesh, I would've taken the first $95K offer out of fear. The Memorial Fund gave me power."

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Toxic Boss, Clean Exit
**Navigate safely, land new role**

**Problem:**
Alex (marketing manager) has toxic boss. Boss takes credit for Alex's work, criticizes in front of team, blocks promotion. Alex stressed, not sleeping, thinking about quitting without plan. Family depends on income ($85K).

**Work Tetrahedron:**
- 💼 **Alex** (blue): Documents toxicity, tracks job search progress
- 👔 **Manager** (green): NOT IN MESH (they're the problem)
- 🎯 **Mentor** (purple): Former colleague now at different company, provides guidance
- 🤝 **Peer Ally** (amber): Colleague who also reports to toxic boss, mutual support

**Toxic Workplace Detector:**
```
TOXICITY SCORE: 8.2/10 (CRISIS)
- Boss takes credit (happened 4 times in 3 months)
- Public criticism (yelled in team meeting)
- Promotion blocked (no explanation)
- Stress symptoms (panic attacks Sunday night, insomnia)

RECOMMENDATION: Exit within 90 days. This is damaging your health.
```

**Exit Plan (Mentor + Peer coordinate):**
```
WEEKS 1-4: Document + Prepare
- Alex: Screenshot all work emails (proof you did the work)
- Alex: Document incidents (dates, witnesses, what was said)
- Mentor: Review resume, refresh LinkedIn, identify target companies
- Peer: Provide LinkedIn recommendation, agree to be reference

WEEKS 5-8: Job Search
- Alex: Apply to 15 jobs/week (target: 60 applications)
- Mentor: Mock interviews, salary negotiation prep
- Peer: Introduce to contacts at target companies
- Network: 8 informational interviews (Mentor helps set up)

WEEKS 9-12: Negotiate + Exit
- Alex: 3 offers (Mentor advises on negotiation)
- Accept: $95K role (10% increase + better culture)
- Resign: 2-week notice, professional (don't burn bridge)
- Exit interview: Say nothing negative (protect yourself)

MEMORIAL FUND BACKUP:
- If you need to quit for mental health: $8K covers 6 weeks expenses
- If you get fired before you can quit: $12K covers 8 weeks job search
```

**Result:**
- 11 weeks: Alex has offer, resigns
- New role: Better pay, better boss, better culture
- Health: Sleep back to normal, panic attacks stopped
- Says: "I didn't think I could leave. The mesh showed me I could. And I did."

### Use Case 2: Freelancer Income Crash
**Collective mobilizes, crisis averted**

**Problem:**
Taylor (freelance graphic designer) has income cliff. Lost biggest client (50% of revenue), pipeline empty, runway 45 days. Considering giving up freelancing, getting job (but loves autonomy).

**Freelancer Collective:**
- 💼 **Taylor** (blue): Designer, struggling with sales
- 💼 **Sam** (green): Web developer, has overflow work
- 💼 **Jamie** (purple): Copywriter, knows Taylor's skills
- 💼 **Morgan** (amber): Project manager, client relationships

**Guardian Node Alert:**
```
⚠️ INCOME CLIFF DETECTED

Taylor's data:
- Revenue: $15K → $9K → $4K (down 73% in 3 months)
- Pipeline: $0 booked next 60 days
- Runway: 45 days
- Mental state: "I'm done. Getting a job."

CRISIS: Taylor quitting freelancing in 30 days without intervention
```

**Collective Response:**
```
DAY 1: Emergency meeting
- Sam: "I have overflow web design work. Can you do UI design for my client? $3K, 2 weeks."
- Jamie: "My client needs brand refresh. Let's collaborate 50/50, your design + my copy. $5K total."
- Morgan: "Let's do sales sprint. You, me, coffee shop, 4 hours, we each pitch 10 clients."

DAY 3: Sales sprint
- Taylor pitches 10 clients (Morgan provides accountability)
- 2 respond (20% response rate, better than usual)
- 1 books discovery call

DAY 7: Collaborations start
- Sam's UI project: $3K (covers this month's expenses)
- Jamie's brand project: $2.5K (Taylor's split)

DAY 14: New client closes
- Discovery call → proposal → signed
- $6K project, 4 weeks
- Client found via referral from Morgan

DAY 30: Crisis averted
- Revenue booked next 60 days: $11.5K
- Runway: Back to 90 days
- Mental state: "I was going to quit. The collective saved my business."
```

**Memorial Fund:**
- Standing by, ready to deploy $10K if sales sprint failed
- Not needed (collective mobilized fast)
- Taylor contributed $500 to Memorial Fund afterward ("Pay it forward")

### Use Case 3: Startup Co-founder Burnout
**Guardian Node detects, mesh intervenes, crisis avoided**

**Problem:**
Casey (CTO) working 80-hour weeks, shipping product, ignoring health. CEO focused on fundraising (doesn't see CTO burnout). COO worried but doesn't want to distract CTO. Product launching in 4 weeks.

**Startup Co-founder Mesh:**
- 💼 **CEO** (blue): Vision, fundraising, external
- 💼 **Casey (CTO)** (green): Product, engineering, burning out
- 💼 **COO** (purple): Operations, worried about Casey
- 💼 **CFO** (amber): Finance, watching runway

**Guardian Node Detects:**
```
⚠️ BURNOUT CRISIS: Casey (CTO)

DATA (Last 8 weeks):
- Work hours: 55 → 65 → 75 → 82 hours/week
- Sleep: 7 hours → 6 hours → 5 hours → 4.5 hours
- Mood: "stressed" every day for 6 weeks straight
- Physical: Headaches daily, chest tightness (2x this week)
- Behavior: Snapping at team, missing meetings, mistakes increasing

BURNOUT RISK: IMMINENT CRASH (likely breakdown within 7 days)

ALERT: CEO, COO, CFO
- CTO is going to crash. Possibly hospitalization. Product launch at risk.
- Intervention needed NOW. Casey cannot sustain 82-hour weeks + 4.5 hours sleep.
```

**Co-founder Emergency Meeting:**
```
CEO: "I had no idea it was this bad. What do you need?"
CTO: "I... I don't know. I just keep pushing. Launch is in 4 weeks."
COO: "Can we push the launch? Or bring in contractors?"
CFO: "We have $15K in budget. Can we hire help?"

DECISION:
- Push launch 2 weeks (4 weeks → 6 weeks)
- Hire 2 contract engineers ($8K total, 2 weeks, take over Casey's non-critical tasks)
- Casey takes 3 days off (forced vacation, no laptop)
- Reduce Casey's hours: 82/week → 50/week (sustainable)
- Weekly burnout check-ins (prevent this from happening again)
```

**Result:**
- Casey takes 3 days off (sleeps, cries, recovers)
- Contractors handle 30% of remaining work
- Product launches in 6 weeks (2 weeks late, but LAUNCHED)
- Casey back to 50-hour weeks, sleeping 7 hours, mood improving
- Says: "I was going to have a breakdown. I felt it coming but couldn't stop. The Guardian Node forced the conversation. Probably saved my life."

**WITHOUT MESH:**
- Casey works 82-hour weeks for 4 more weeks
- Crashes (hospitalization or quits)
- Product launch fails (no CTO to ship)
- Startup dies
- Co-founders blame each other

**WITH MESH:**
- Early detection (Guardian Node)
- Coordinated intervention (co-founders aligned)
- Problem solved (hired help, pushed deadline)
- Product ships, Casey healthy, startup survives

## Why Work Tetrahedron Works

### 1. Burnout Detected Before Breakdown
**Current system: Work until crash, then recover.**

- Employee working 60-hour weeks (seems fine)
- Sleep deteriorating (pushed through)
- Mood declining (white-knuckled it)
- Then: Breakdown, medical leave, quit without plan, income stops

**With Work Tetrahedron:**
- Guardian Node flags burnout risk (week 4 of unsustainable pace)
- All 4 vertices alerted (Manager + Mentor + Peer see data)
- Manager: "What can I take off your plate?"
- Mentor: "This pace will crash you. Set boundaries NOW."
- Peer: "I'll cover your Friday meeting so you can take a mental health day."
- Employee: Takes action before breakdown (reduces hours, delegates, takes PTO)
- No crash, no medical leave, career continues

**EARLY = INTERVENTION  
LATE = CATASTROPHE**

---

### 2. Layoffs Land Softer
**Current system: Laid off, scramble alone, take first desperate offer.**

- Employee laid off (surprise or not)
- Severance: 2 weeks (not enough)
- Unemployment: Doesn't cover bills
- 30 days: Panic sets in (rent due, no income)
- 60 days: Take first shitty offer (desperation)
- Result: Lower pay, worse role, resentment

**With Work Tetrahedron:**
- Guardian Node predicted layoff risk 65% (6 months early)
- Employee already job searching (not scrambling)
- Layoff happens (but employee has 3 interviews lined up)
- Memorial Fund: $15K covers 3 months (no desperation)
- Employee takes RIGHT job, not desperate job (negotiates from strength)
- Result: Better pay, better culture, no trauma

**MESH CATCHES YOU → LAND ON YOUR FEET**

---

### 3. Freelancers Have Stability
**Current system: Feast or famine, constantly terrified.**

- Freelancer has 2 good months ($15K each)
- Then: 1 slow month ($3K)
- Panic: "I'm going to lose my apartment"
- Desperate: Takes shitty client (pays late, scope creeps, nightmare)
- Burnout: Can't sustain this volatility

**With Work Tetrahedron (Freelancer Collective):**
- 4 freelancers revenue-share (smooth out peaks/valleys)
- Freelancer 1 has slow month (others cover with their projects)
- Freelancer 2 has busy month (brings others onto projects)
- Income: Each person gets $8K-12K/month (consistent, not $3K-$20K swings)
- Memorial Fund: Standing by if collective has slow quarter
- Result: Stability, no panic, sustainable careers

**COLLECTIVE = INCOME STABILITY**

---

### 4. Toxic Workplaces Exited Cleanly
**Current system: Stay too long, damage yourself, quit without plan.**

- Employee has toxic boss (takes credit, criticizes publicly)
- Employee suffers (panic attacks, insomnia, crying)
- Employee thinks: "I can't leave, I need the money"
- 2 years: Employee finally quits (burned out, no plan, forced to take break)
- 6 months: Recovers, then job searches (savings depleted)

**With Work Tetrahedron:**
- Toxic Workplace Detector: Score 8.2/10 (crisis level)
- Alert sent to Mentor + Peer (NOT toxic boss)
- 90-day exit plan (document, job search, land offer, resign)
- Employee leaves BEFORE breakdown (health intact)
- New job: Better pay, better culture, no medical leave needed
- Result: Career continues, no trauma

**MESH GIVES YOU PERMISSION TO LEAVE**
