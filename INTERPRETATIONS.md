# The Homepage: What Do You See?

## Same Animation. Different Truths.

The homepage shows a breathing geometric transformation. Pure mathematics rendered in real-time. No words. Just:
- **Shapes**: Y ↔ △
- **Colors**: Purple ↔ Blue  
- **Numbers**: 1 → 4 (cycling)

But what you see depends on who you are.

## What Do YOU See?

**Same animation.**  
**Same mathematics.**  
**Different truth for every observer.**

This is the power of universal language.

No words. No instructions. No explanation.

Just:
- **Numbers** (1 → 4)
- **Colors** (Purple ↔ Blue)
- **Shapes** (Y ↔ △)

And somehow... it speaks to everyone.

Because the math doesn't lie.  
The physics doesn't discriminate.  
The geometry just **is**.

**What do you see?**

*The answer reveals who you are.*
